C3D Render Buddy
================

C3D Render Buddy is a utility for [Cheetah 3D](http://cheetah3d.com/) users that lets them quickly view
and manipulate their render history (and I keep promising to add other functionality to it).

This is a port to node-webkit of a utility originally written in Realbasic (now Xojo).

You may find this interesting as an example of an application written using node-webkit, although it will
only be useful on Mac OS X if you use Cheetah 3D (otherwise the relevant files won't be there).
